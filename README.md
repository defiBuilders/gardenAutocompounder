## How to use:

Once you've entered your wallet information, you will be able to select a compound rate. The compound rate is the amount of plants at which the compound action will occur. For example, if you have 2000 plants and you select a compound rate of 500, then your plant compound is set for 2500 plants and consecutively at multiples of 500 from that point on. 

First compound:
- Plants ready: 2000
- Rate: 500
- Planned to compound at: 2500

Second compound:
- Plants ready: 0
- Rate: 500
- Planned to compound at: 500

Third compound:
- Plants ready: 0
- Rate: 500
- Planned to compound at: 500
